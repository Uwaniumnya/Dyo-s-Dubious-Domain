MBDB Image Placeholder Specification
=====================================

**Main Subject:** MBDB (N-Methyl-1,3-benzodioxolylbutanamine)
**Category:** Empathogen/Research Chemical
**Style:** Research chemical/scientific with Shulgin reference

**Visual Elements:**

1. **Chemical Focus (Primary)**
   - White crystalline powder in small research quantities
   - Glass vials with research chemical labels
   - Analytical balance showing precise measurements
   - White/off-white fine crystals similar to MDMA
   - Laboratory-grade storage containers

2. **Molecular Structure (Key Element)**
   - MBDB molecular structure diagram (C₁₂H₁₇NO₂)
   - Side-by-side comparison with MDMA structure
   - Highlighting the structural differences (methyl group on alpha carbon)
   - Chemical formula and molecular weight display
   - 3D molecular model representation

3. **PiHKAL Reference Context**
   - PiHKAL book (Entry #109) open to MBDB page
   - Alexander Shulgin's laboratory notebook aesthetics
   - Vintage scientific equipment and glassware
   - 1980s research laboratory atmosphere
   - Chemical synthesis pathway diagrams

4. **Research Chemical Elements**
   - "NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION" labeling
   - Scientific research context symbols
   - Quality control/purity testing equipment
   - Vendor packaging with research chemical disclaimers
   - Laboratory safety equipment

5. **Gentler Experience Visualization**
   - Soft, calming colors (blues, gentle purples)
   - Peaceful, meditative imagery elements
   - Contrast with MDMA's more intense visual representation
   - Longer duration timeline graphics
   - Gentle wave patterns suggesting smoother experience

6. **Safety Warnings**
   - "LIMITED HUMAN DATA" warning prominently displayed
   - Unknown long-term effects caution symbols
   - Research chemical safety protocols
   - Extended spacing recommendations between uses

**Color Scheme:**
- Scientific white and blue backgrounds
- Soft blues and purples for gentler experience
- Clinical laboratory color palette
- Vintage sepia tones for PiHKAL/Shulgin context
- Clear warning red for safety information

**Layout:**
- Central focus on crystalline powder and molecular structure
- Left side: PiHKAL reference and Shulgin laboratory context
- Right side: research chemical warnings and safety protocols
- Bottom: molecular comparison with MDMA
- Background: subtle laboratory/scientific equipment

**Typography:**
- Scientific journal font for main title "MBDB"
- Chemical nomenclature in standard chemical notation
- Research warning text in clear, bold font
- PiHKAL reference in vintage book typography
- Safety warnings in attention-grabbing format

**Mood/Tone:**
- Serious scientific research atmosphere
- Academic/scholarly approach to psychoactive research
- Respect for Shulgin's scientific legacy
- Caution about unknown risks
- Gentle, introspective quality distinguishing from MDMA

**Key Message:**
"Shulgin's gentler alternative to MDMA - deeper introspection with less stimulation, but with all the unknowns of research chemical territory."

**Usage Context:**
This image will accompany the comprehensive MBDB profile, emphasizing both its scientific pedigree through Shulgin's research and the caution needed when dealing with substances that lack extensive human safety data.
