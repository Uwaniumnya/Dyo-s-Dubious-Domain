**Style:** Colorful, visual-focused with empathogenic warmth

**Visual Elements:**

1. **Crystal/Substance Focus (Primary)**
   - White to off-white crystalline powder with slight color tints
   - Chunky crystal formations catching and refracting light
   - Rainbow light refractions through crystals
   - Multiple crystal forms showing various textures
   - Laboratory-grade substance presentation

2. **Psychedelic Visual Elements (Key Feature)**
   - Kaleidoscopic patterns and fractal designs
   - Geometric mandalas and sacred geometry
   - Flowing, organic patterns with bright colors
   - Color-shifting visual effects and rainbow spectrums
   - Synesthetic representations (sound-to-color visualizations)
   - Closed and open-eye visual representations

3. **Empathogenic Symbolism**
   - Heart symbols integrated with psychedelic patterns
   - Warm, connecting energy flows between elements
   - Human silhouettes in embracing/connecting poses
   - Love and connection iconography with psychedelic twist
   - Emotional warmth color palette (golds, warm purples)

4. **Molecular Structure & Chemistry**
   - MDA molecular diagram (C₁₀H₁₃NO₂) prominently displayed
   - Comparison structure with MDMA highlighting differences
   - Chemical bonds shown with colorful, glowing effects
   - 3D molecular model with psychedelic coloring
   - Chemical formula integrated into visual patterns

5. **Duration & Effects Timeline**
   - Extended 6-8 hour timeline visualization
   - Clock faces showing longer duration vs MDMA
   - Wave patterns showing extended peak period

- Electric blues and bright magentas
- Crystalline whites and clear refractions
- Deep blacks for contrast and depth
- Gradient transitions between all colors

**Layout:**
- Central focus on colorful crystals with light refraction
- Left side: molecular structure and chemical information
- Right side: visual effects and psychedelic patterns
- Top: duration timeline and "Sally" cultural context
- Bottom: empathogenic symbols and connection imagery
- Background: subtle kaleidoscopic patterns

**Typography:**
- Bold "MDA" title with rainbow gradient effects
- "Sally" nickname in flowing, 1960s-inspired font
- Chemical information in clean, scientific typography
- Effect descriptions in warm, approachable fonts
- Timeline information in clear, readable format

**Mood/Tone:**
- Vibrant and visually stimulating
- Warm empathogenic connection energy
