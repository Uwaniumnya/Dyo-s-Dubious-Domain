Users often report feeling \"stimulated but not satisfied.\" Side Effect Profile Notable for producing more negative side effects than positive ones, including severe nausea, headaches, and an unpleasant \"speedy\" feeling without the positive mood effects of other stimulants. Long Duration Effects last significantly longer than MDMA (6-8 hours vs 4-6 hours), often leaving users feeling overstimulated and unable to sleep. üß† Pharmacology & Neuroscience Primary Mechanism of Action BZP acts primarily as a norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent with some serotonin activity. Unlike MDMA, it has much weaker serotonin effects, explaining why it lacks the strong empathogenic and euphoric qualities. It binds to monoamine transporters and causes release of stored neurotransmitters, but with a different selectivity profile than MDMA.

Consumed by over 90% of adults worldwide in some form. Tolerance Paradox Rapid tolerance development means most regular users consume it primarily to avoid withdrawal rather than achieve enhancement - yet they perceive benefits. Cognitive Performance Window Optimal cognitive benefits occur in a narrow dose range - too little has no effect, too much causes anxiety that impairs performance. üß† Pharmacology & Neuroscience Primary Mechanism of Action Caffeine is a non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist. It blocks adenosine receptors (A1 and A2A) in the brain, preventing adenosine from binding and promoting wakefulness. Adenosine normally accumulates during wakefulness and promotes sleepiness - caffeine blocks this \"sleep pressure\" signal. This leads to secondary effects on dopamine, norepinephrine, and other neurotransmitter systems. Detailed Receptor Pharmacology Adenosine A1 receptor High affinity antagonist (Ki: ~40 ŒºM) Primary wakefulness, alertness effects Adenosine A2A receptor High affinity antagonist (Ki: ~2.4 ŒºM) Motor activation, reduced fatigue perception Phosphodiesterase enzymes Weak inhibition (high doses) Increased cAMP, enhanced cellular signaling Ryanodine receptors Modulation at high doses Calcium release, muscle effects Secondary Neurotransmitter Effects Dopamine enhancement: A2A antagonism in striatum increases dopamine activity Norepinephrine increase: Indirect stimulation through adenosine receptor blockade Acetylcholine modulation: Enhanced cholinergic signaling in attention networks GABA interaction: Complex modulation of inhibitory signaling Histamine ef...",

Users often consume entire supplies in single sessions, leading to dangerous binges lasting hours or days. Critical Warning: Street cocaine purity varies wildly. Start with small amounts to assess potency. Crack cocaine is significantly more addictive due to rapid onset and short duration. ‚ú® Effects Profile Timeline - Powder Cocaine (Intranasal) T+0:01-0:03 Onset - euphoria, energy, confidence surge T+0:05-0:30 Peak - intense euphoria, hyperfocus, sociability T+0:30-1:00 Comedown - energy crash, depression, craving T+1:00-4:00 After effects - fatigue, depression, irritability Timeline - Crack Cocaine (Smoked) T+0:00:10-0:00:30 Immediate intense rush, euphoria T+0:01-0:05 Peak euphoria, hyperstimulation T+0:05-0:15 Rapid comedown, immediate craving T+0:15-2:00 Depression, agitation, compulsive redosing urge ‚úÅEPositive Effects Intense euphoria and wellbeing Dramatically increased confidence Enhanced energy and alertness Hyperfocus and mental clarity (temporarily) Increased sociability and talkativeness Suppressed appetite and fatigue Enhanced sexual desire Feeling of invincibility ‚ùÅENegative Effects Severe cardiovascular strain Paranoia and anxiety Compulsive redosing behavior Rapid tolerance development Intense comedown depression Hyperthermia and sweating Jaw clenching and teeth grinding Insomnia and sleep disruption Aggressive or erratic behavior Nasal damage (when snorted) üîó Addiction & Dependence Profile Cocaine has one of the highest addiction potentials of any substance. The combination of intense euphoria, short duration, and severe comedown creates a powerful cycle of compulsive redosing. Crack cocaine is even more addictive due to faster onset and shorter duration. Psychological dependence: Can develop after single use Tolerance: Develops rapidly, requiring higher doses Withdrawal: Severe depression, fatigue, anhedonia, intense cravings Relapse risk: Extremely high due to powerful cue-induced cravings üß† Pharmacology & Neuroscience Primary Mechanism of Action Cocaine is a potent dopamine transporter (DAT) blocker with additional effects on norepinephrine and serotonin transporters. It binds to and blocks these transporters, preventing the reuptake of neurotransmitters and causing massive accumulation in synaptic clefts. The dopamine blockade in the nucleus accumbens (reward center) is primarily responsible for cocaine's intense euphoric and addictive properties.

By inhibiting PDE5, sildenafil allows cGMP levels to remain elevated, leading to smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation in the corpus cavernosum of the penis and pulmonary vasculature. This mechanism requires nitric oxide (NO) release for cGMP synthesis, making sildenafil dependent on natural sexual arousal for erectile effects.

Xylazine is designed for animals and has no established human dosage. Street use leads to unpredictable sedation, respiratory depression, and horrific skin necrosis. This substance should NEVER be used by humans. ‚ö†ÔøΩEÔøΩEVETERINARY DOSING REFERENCE ONLY The following is veterinary dosing information provided solely for educational purposes. Human use is extremely dangerous and causes skin necrosis. Veterinary (Large Animals) 0.1-0.3 mg/kg Veterinary (Small Animals) 0.5-2.2 mg/kg Human Contamination Unknown - Causes Necrosis Street Mixtures Unpredictable - Flesh Damage Any Human Use Guaranteed Tissue Death Critical Risk Factors No human safety data: Designed for veterinary use only Immediate skin necrosis: Begins within hours of first exposure Naloxone resistant: Cannot be reversed with standard overdose antidotes Spreads beyond injection sites: Necrosis occurs even without direct injection Progressive tissue death: Continues even after stopping use Amputation risk: Advanced necrosis requires limb amputation LIFE-SAVING WARNING: Any human exposure to xylazine risks permanent tissue damage and horrific skin necrosis. Seek immediate medical attention for any suspected exposure. ‚ú® Effects Profile Timeline (Human Contamination) T+0:15-0:30 Onset - sedation, respiratory depression, skin damage begins T+0:30-4:00 Peak - deep sedation, unconsciousness, tissue necrosis visible T+4:00-8:00 Duration - continued sedation, progressive skin death T+8:00+ Recovery - sedation fades, skin necrosis permanent and progressive ‚úÅEIntended Veterinary Effects Muscle relaxation in animals Sedation for veterinary procedures Analgesia (pain relief) in animals Reduced anxiety in veterinary settings Controlled anesthesia induction Reversible with specific antidotes (animals) ‚ùÅEHuman Toxicity Effects Horrific skin necrosis and tissue death Severe respiratory depression Dangerous hypotension (low blood pressure) Bradycardia (dangerously slow heart rate) Deep unconsciousness and coma Naloxone-resistant overdose Progressive flesh-eating lesions Gangrene and infection Amputation requirements Permanent disfigurement üß† Pharmacology & Neuroscience Primary Mechanism of Action Xylazine is a selective Œ±‚ÇÅEadrenergic receptor agonist that produces sedation, muscle relaxation, and analgesia through central nervous system depression. Unlike opioids, it acts on adrenergic pathways, making it unresponsive to naloxone. Its vasoconstrictive properties cause severe tissue ischemia and necrosis in humans.
