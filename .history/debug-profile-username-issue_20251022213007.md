# Debug Profile Picture Issue

## 🔍 What's happening:
1. ✅ Profile picture uploads successfully 
2. ❌ Username changes to "anonymous"
3. ❌ Profile picture disappears on reload

## 🧪 Debug Steps:

### In Browser Developer Tools:

1. **Open Network Tab** (F12 → Network)
2. **Upload a profile picture**
3. **Look for these requests:**
   - `PUT /api/profile` - Should save the profile data
   - Check the status code (200 = success, 502/500 = error)
   - Check the response body for any error messages

4. **Check what data is being sent:**
   - Click on the `PUT /api/profile` request
   - Look at the "Request" tab to see what profile data is being sent
   - It should include your username, not just image data

## 🔧 Expected vs Actual:

**Expected profile data:**
```json
{
  "username": "Uwaniumnya",
  "profilePicture": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/...",
  "bannerImage": "none",
  "bio": "Your bio text"
}
```

**What's probably happening:**
```json
{
  "profilePicture": "data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/...",
  "bannerImage": "none",
  "avatar_url": "none",
  "banner_url": "none"
}
```

## 🎯 The Fix:
The profile save function is only sending image data and overwriting the existing username. The frontend should merge the new image with existing profile data, not replace it entirely.

Please check the Network tab and let me know what the PUT request shows!
