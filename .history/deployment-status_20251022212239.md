Deployment Status Check - GitHub Pages

The main authentication system is now working! ðŸŽ‰

Minor remaining issues:
1. Some 404s may appear until GitHub Pages finishes updating (2-5 minutes after push)
2. CSP warnings are from browser extensions, not our code
3. Missing favicon can be added later

Core functionality working:
âœ… User authentication 
âœ… Login/logout system
âœ… Profile management
âœ… Image uploads (with 10MB limit)
âœ… Database connectivity
âœ… CORS properly configured
âœ… Backend stable and running

All major deployment issues have been resolved!
